             <section class="light">
               <p>Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia. The Trust began consideration of erecting a building of its own in 1967 and formed a building committee in 1968. In 1969 it acquired a lease for land on Northbourne Avenue, the current site, and engaged the architect Robin Boyd to design the building.
                 The building was to provide offices for the Trust and in addition was to provide rental office accommodation for commercial tenants as a means of generating income for the Trust.</p>

                <p>Features of the original design included: </p>
               <ul>
                   <li>A glass exhibition pavilion, on the site of the current north wing, which housed a display on the work of the Trust;</li>
                   <li>The flat roof area of the east and south wings which was intended to be a roof terrace; and</li>
                   <li>Accommodation in the building included a board room, dining room, reception area, bar and kitchen.</li>
               </ul>
               <!-- Contrasting the overview page, you can see that when not using the column class, I am able to provide line breaks by distinguihsing multiple paragraphs  -->
               <p>The cost of the works was about $1 million. The building was officially opened on 14 April 1972.
Boyd died in 1971 before completion, and W K Williams was engaged by the Trust as its site representative to replace Boyd.</p>
<p>During the 1990s the glass pavilion was replaced by the current north wing.</p>

                <h1>Stylistic Analysis</h1>
                   <p>Churchill House is one of a number of Canberra buildings designed in the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style. These include:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>National Gallery of Australia, 1971;</li>
                       <li>Cameron Offices, 1976;</li>
                       <li>Canberra School of Music, 1976; and</li>
                       <li>High Court of Australia, 1980.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Churchill House displays several key features of the style, such as:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
                       <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</li>
                   </ul>
                   </section>
                   <section class="darkdisplay">

                     <!-- It is hard to keep track of all the li tags  -->
                   <p>In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Sloping structural fins, being the structural steel members supporting the glazing at the corner between the east and south wings.</li>
                       <li>Precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, being the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.</li>
                       <li>Precast fins for sun protection, as above.</li>
                       <li>Vertical slit windows, also being a part of the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>The building generally appears to be in fair to good condition. A number of changes have been made which diminish its integrity including:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>The replacement of the original glass pavilion with the current north wing, albeit with a sympathetic design;</li>
                       <li>The non-original window-mounted airconditioners which detract from the south elevation;</li>
                       <li>Many of the interior fitouts appear to have been modernised; and</li>
                       <li>There are a number of non-original surface mounted conduits internally.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>None the less, the building retains substantial components and details of the original design.</p>
